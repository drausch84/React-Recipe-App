## About This Project
It has been a while since I worked with React, in fact it's been a couple of years.  Since that time, there have been interesting developments such as the introduction of Hooks back in 2019.  I didn't want to lose my ability to fully understand how to work with React so I decided to do a deep dive in how hooks work as well as refamiliarizing myself with the concept of Contexts, Function Components, etc.  This Recipe Application is your standard TODO application, yet utilizes these React concepts to allow the user to add, delete, and edit different recipes.  The CSS is incredibly basic and will be updated in the near future, but the functionality is all there.
